<!doctype html> <!-- indicates that this is a html5 document -->
<html lang="en-US"> <!-- important for accessibility and search engines -->

<!-- In the head element is metadata about the page -->
<head> <title>This is the page title</title> </head> 

<! -- In the body element is user-visible content -->
<body>
<h1>Heading... 1?!?!?!?!</h1> 
<h2>Heading 2. And they decrease in size as heading N increases...</h2>
<h3>Heading 3. Be mindful of what you use as headings: search engines index pages based on them.</h3>
<p>This belongs to its own paragraph. <br>This &lt;br&gt; tag is for a newline.</p>
<p>The next p tag is two lines underneath the last paragraph</p>
<p>Text
in    a     p    tag 
can be    spaced arbitrarily   in 
the
source 
but these spaces     are ignored by the browser.</p>
<pre>
If you want 
the spacing in the source 
to instead
be 
p r e s e r v e d ,
use of the &lt;pre&gt; tag allows you to,
and forces a monospace font.</pre>
<p>Everything between the body tags is visible on the page.</p>

<p>You can include an image in a paragraph tag: <img src ="Dead_rising_frank_bust.png" alt="frank" height="60"> ...this is a more explicit example of
nested tags. But the whole document is nested inside the &lt;html&gt; tag.<br>If the image does not exist, the alt attribute is used: 
<img src="DNE.png" alt="Picture stand-in"></p>
<br>
<button>You can include buttons</button>

<p>You can include links to <a href="https://www.google.com">stuff</a> too.</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can make</li>
    <li>a list of unordered items</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Or, if order is important,</li>
    <li>a list of ordered items</li>
</ol>

<p>Characters are escaped with particular codes. &lt; is done with '& lt ;' and so on.</p>

<p>An <b>HTML element</b> is an entity consisting of a start tag, the content sandwiched between, and the end tag.</p>
<p title="mouseover">An <b>HTML attribute</b> are like command-line arguments found in the start tag of an HTML element. The attribute
"title" was added to this paragraph's start tag. Hover over this paragraph to see.<br>Single or double quotes to indicate value of an 
attribute are both OK.</p>

<p>The horizontal rule tag &lt;hr&gt; makes the horizontal line<hr>separating this blurb.</p>

<p>With the 'style' attribute applied to a &lt;p&gt; tag, you can do some cool stuff.<br>
You can change <p style="color:blue;">the color</p> of text, its <p style="font-size:200%;">size</p>, or <p style="color:blue; font-size:200%;">both
at the same time.</p>But doing it this way you can only change paragraphs at a time.</p>

<!-- <p style="color:[color of text]; background-color:[color of background body or this paragraph]; font-family:[verdana, courier, etc];
     font-size:[size of text as percent or px]; text-align:[horizontal for horizontal alignment]; border:2px solid Tomato;
     background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5) [can use rgb/rgba/hsl/hsla/hex];"     -->

<!-- <tagname style="property:value;"> is the format for the 'style' attribute, where property and value are CSS properties and values -->

<p>Now for text formatting...<br>
<b>Bold text</b><br>
<strong>"Important" text</strong><br>
<i>Italicized text</i><br>
<em>"Emphasized" text</em><br>
<mark>Marked text</mark><br>
<small>Small text LOL</small><br>
<del>Deleted text</del><br>
<ins>Inserted text</ins><br>
<u>Underlined text</u><br>
You can use subscripts<sub>like this</sub> or superscripts<sup>like this</sup><br>

<blockquote>You can make fancy blockquotes<br>such as this</blockquote>

The &lt;bdo&gt; tag makes the text inside display differently, such as right to left: <bdo dir="rtl">like this</bdo>
</p>

<p>Many elements can be given the same class attribute so operations can be done on that class, <br>but
each element can be assigned a unique ID with an ID attribute (a name). So an external css document can <br>
style everything with a certain class one way, but have an exception for a certain ID.<br>An element can belong to more than one class.<br>
Elements of different types (paragraphs, hyperlinks etc.) can belong to the same class.</p>

<p>The &lt;script&gt; tag is used to define a client-side script using JavaScript. <br>
JS can change html element content, attributes.<br>
<b>The page will not respond to the user during script execution.<br>
So keep scripts short or use the Web Worker API (runs scripts in background).</b>
<br>
The Web Storage API is a more secure, faster, more robust method of storing user data/interactions than cookies.<br>

<!--
HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
